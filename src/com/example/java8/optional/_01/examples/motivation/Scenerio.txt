You've got an AccountDAO:

	public class AccountDAO {
		public Account findById(long id);
	}

Some possible options...:
(1) You could throw a NotFoundException.  But then someone has to catch it.
(2) You could return null, but now you have to document the null behavior and constantly check for null.
(3) You could have two methods...  findExactlyOne(id) and findOneOrNull(id).  But you've got double the work.
(4) You could use java.util.Optional in the method signature.

Look at these examples in the following order:
* PainfulSolution1.java
* PainfulSolution2.java
* PainfulSolution3.java
* SolutionUsingOptional1.java
* SolutionUsingOptional2.java
